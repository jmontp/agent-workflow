## Technical Improvements Implemented

### 1. Resource Management Enhancements
```python
# Fixed ResourceQuota validation for internal calculations
@classmethod
def create_unvalidated(cls, cpu_cores=0.0, memory_mb=0, max_agents=0, 
                      disk_mb=0, network_bandwidth_mbps=0.0):
    """Create ResourceQuota without validation for internal calculations"""
    quota = cls.__new__(cls)
    quota.cpu_cores = cpu_cores
    quota.memory_mb = memory_mb
    quota.max_agents = max_agents
    quota.disk_mb = disk_mb
    quota.network_bandwidth_mbps = network_bandwidth_mbps
    quota._skip_validation = True
    return quota
```

### 2. Queue Management Corrections
```python
# Fixed heap queue handling for task management
self.global_task_queue = [
    task_tuple for task_tuple in self.global_task_queue
    if task_tuple[2].project_name != project_name
]
heapq.heapify(self.global_task_queue)  # Restore heap property
```

### 3. Floating Point Precision Handling
```python
# Enhanced precision handling for efficiency calculations
assert abs(score - 0.0) < 1e-10  # Allow for floating point precision
```

### 4. Async Task Management
```python
# Proper fixture setup for async conflict resolution testing
@pytest.fixture
def conflict_resolver(conflict_resolver_factory):
    """Create a ConflictResolver instance."""
    return conflict_resolver_factory()
```
