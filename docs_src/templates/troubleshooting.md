## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

Start here for fast problem identification:

- [ ] **System Status**: Is the system running and responsive?
- [ ] **Recent Changes**: Were any changes made recently?
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Are system resources (CPU, memory, disk) normal?
- [ ] **Network Connectivity**: Are all network connections working?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Are external services and dependencies available?

### Emergency Actions

If experiencing critical issues:

1. **Immediate Safety**: Stop operations if data integrity at risk
2. **Escalation Path**: Contact on-call team or emergency contacts
3. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of ongoing issues
4. **Documentation**: Record symptoms and actions taken

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 🚨 Critical Issues

#### Issue: System Complete Failure
**Symptoms:**
- Service completely unresponsive
- Error 500 responses or connection timeouts
- No logs being generated

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# Check system status
systemctl status service-name

# Check resource usage
top
df -h
free -m

# Review recent logs
journalctl -u service-name --since "10 minutes ago"
```

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Check Infrastructure**: Verify servers and network connectivity
2. **Review Dependencies**: Confirm database and external services
3. **Examine Logs**: Look for error patterns and stack traces
4. **Validate Configuration**: Check for recent configuration changes

**Common Causes:**
- Infrastructure failure (server, network, storage)
- Database connectivity issues
- Resource exhaustion (memory, disk space)
- Configuration errors from recent deployments

**Resolution Steps:**
```bash
# Restart service (if appropriate)
systemctl restart service-name

# Check and clear disk space if needed
du -sh /var/log/*
logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

# Rollback recent changes if necessary
git checkout previous-stable-version
./deploy.sh rollback
```

**Prevention:**
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Set up automated alerting for resource thresholds
- Establish rollback procedures for deployments
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

---

#### Issue: Performance Degradation
**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times (>5 seconds)
- Timeouts on some requests
- High CPU or memory usage
- User complaints about system slowness

**Diagnostic Commands:**
```bash
# Performance monitoring
htop
iotop
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l

# Application-specific metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics

# Database performance
SHOW PROCESSLIST;  # MySQL
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;  # PostgreSQL
```

**Common Causes:**
- Database query performance issues
- Memory leaks or excessive memory usage
- High concurrent user load
- Inefficient algorithms or code paths
- Network latency or bandwidth issues

**Resolution Steps:**
1. **Identify Bottleneck**: Use profiling tools to find the root cause
2. **Scale Resources**: Increase CPU, memory, or add instances
3. **Optimize Queries**: Review and optimize slow database queries
4. **Enable Caching**: Implement or tune caching mechanisms
5. **Load Balance**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances

### ⚠️ Warning Level Issues

#### Issue: Authentication Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Users unable to log in
- "Invalid credentials" errors for valid accounts
- Session timeouts or unexpected logouts

**Diagnostic Steps:**
```bash
# Check authentication service
curl -X POST /api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"test"}'

# Review authentication logs
grep "authentication" /var/log/application.log

# Test database connectivity
mysql -u app_user -p -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```

**Common Solutions:**
- Verify authentication service configuration
- Check database connectivity and user table integrity
- Review password policy and account lockout settings
- Validate SSL/TLS certificate configuration

#### Issue: Data Synchronization Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Inconsistent data between systems
- Missing records or outdated information
- Synchronization errors in logs

**Diagnostic Approach:**
```bash
# Check sync service status
systemctl status sync-service

# Compare record counts
echo "System A:" && curl /api/system-a/count
echo "System B:" && curl /api/system-b/count

# Review sync logs
tail -f /var/log/sync.log | grep ERROR
```

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Manual data reconciliation for critical records
- Restart synchronization services
- Check network connectivity between systems
- Validate API credentials and permissions

### 💡 Information Level Issues

#### Issue: Configuration Warnings
**Symptoms:**
- Warning messages in logs
- Non-optimal performance
- Feature limitations or restrictions

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Review configuration
cat /etc/app/config.yaml
grep -r "WARNING" /var/log/

# Validate configuration syntax
config-validator --file /etc/app/config.yaml
```

**Typical Actions:**
- Update configuration to recommended values
- Enable additional features or optimizations
- Document acceptable warnings vs. issues requiring action

## Systematic Troubleshooting Process

### 🔍 Problem Identification

#### Step 1: Gather Information
```bash
# System information
uname -a
uptime
who

# Service status
systemctl status --all | grep failed
docker ps -a

# Resource utilization
free -h
df -h
iostat 1 5
```

#### Step 2: Reproduce the Issue
- **Document Steps**: Exact sequence to reproduce the problem
- **Environment Details**: OS, browser, network conditions
- **Timing Information**: When the issue occurs (peak hours, specific times)
- **User Impact**: How many users affected and severity

#### Step 3: Check Recent Changes
```bash
# Recent deployments
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago"

# System changes
rpm -qa --last | head -20  # RHEL/CentOS
dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall | tail -20  # Debian/Ubuntu

# Configuration changes
find /etc -name "*.conf" -mtime -7 -ls
```

### 🛠️ Problem Resolution

#### Step 4: Hypothesis Formation
Based on symptoms and evidence:
1. **Primary Hypothesis**: Most likely cause based on evidence
2. **Alternative Hypotheses**: Other possible causes to investigate
3. **Test Plan**: How to validate or eliminate each hypothesis

#### Step 5: Testing and Validation
```bash
# Controlled testing
# Test hypothesis 1
test-command --specific-flag

# Validate results
verify-command --check-output

# Document findings
echo "Test result: [outcome]" >> troubleshooting.log
```

#### Step 6: Implementation and Verification
```bash
# Apply fix
fix-command --apply-solution

# Verify resolution
health-check --full-validation

# Monitor for recurrence
tail -f /var/log/application.log | grep -i error
```

    echo "WARNING: Memory usage at ${MEMORY_USAGE}%"
fi

# Disk space
DISK_USAGE=$(df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt 85 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Disk usage at ${DISK_USAGE}%"
fi

# Application health
curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || echo "ERROR: Application health check failed"
```

#### Log Analysis
```bash
# Error pattern analysis
grep -c "ERROR" /var/log/app.log
awk '/ERROR/ {count++} END {print "Error count:", count+0}' /var/log/app.log

# Performance analysis
grep "response_time" /var/log/app.log | awk '{sum+=$NF} END {print "Average response time:", sum/NR}'

# Security analysis
grep -i "authentication failed" /var/log/auth.log | wc -l
```
