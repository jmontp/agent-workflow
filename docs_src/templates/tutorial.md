def example_function(parameter):
    """
    Clear docstring explaining the function.
    
    Args:
        parameter: What this parameter does
    
    Returns:
        What the function returns
    """
    # Step-by-step implementation
    result = process_parameter(parameter)
    return result
```

### Verification
```bash
# Test the implementation
test-command --verify step2
```
