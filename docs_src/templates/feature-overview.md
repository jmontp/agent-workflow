    style C fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:2px
```

### Process Flow
1. **Input**: What triggers or initiates the feature
2. **Processing**: What happens internally
3. **Output**: What users see or experience

## Key Benefits

- **Benefit 1**: Specific value with measurable impact
- **Benefit 2**: User experience improvement
- **Benefit 3**: Technical advantage or efficiency gain

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Step 1: Basic setup
command setup --feature-name

# Step 2: Configuration  
command configure --option value

# Step 3: Verify
command status
```

**Expected Result:**
```
Feature initialized successfully
Status: Active
Configuration: Verified
```

## Core Concepts

### ðŸ”§ Concept 1
Brief explanation of fundamental concept with practical example.

**Example:**
```bash
example command demonstrating concept
```

### ðŸ“Š Concept 2
Brief explanation of another key concept.

**Use Case:**
Real-world scenario where this concept applies.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description | Example |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `setting1` | `default` | What this controls | `--setting1 value` |
| `setting2` | `auto` | When to adjust this | `--setting2 custom` |

## Advanced Usage

### Integration with Other Features
- **Feature A**: How they work together
- **Feature B**: Synergies and combined benefits

### Customization Options
```yaml
# Configuration example
feature:
  enabled: true
  options:
    level: advanced
    timeout: 30s
```

### Performance Tuning
!!! tip "Performance Optimization"
    For high-volume usage, consider adjusting these settings:
    - Setting 1: Recommended values and impact
    - Setting 2: Trade-offs and considerations

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Common Use Case
**Scenario:** Typical user workflow or requirement

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Commands to achieve the scenario
command1 --option value
command2 --flag
```

**Outcome:** What the user accomplishes

### Example 2: Advanced Use Case
**Scenario:** Power user or complex requirement

**Implementation:**
```bash
# More sophisticated command sequence
advanced-command --complex-options
```

**Outcome:** Advanced results or capabilities

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Metric 1: What it measures and why it matters
- Metric 2: Performance indicators
- Metric 3: Success criteria

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check feature status
/status feature-name

# View performance metrics
/metrics feature-name

# Detailed diagnostics
/debug feature-name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check feature health
/health feature-name

# View logs
/logs feature-name --level debug

# Reset to defaults
/reset feature-name
```
