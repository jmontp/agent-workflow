# Phase 7: Context Management System Design - Complete Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document presents the complete design for Phase 7: Context Management System, a comprehensive solution for intelligent agent communication and context optimization within the AI Agent TDD-Scrum workflow system.

## Challenge Statement

The core challenge addressed in Phase 7 is how to efficiently manage context between AI agents in a TDD workflow while respecting Claude Code's ~200k token limitations. Agents need to share context across TDD phases efficiently, with intelligent filtering and compression to maximize the usefulness of limited token budgets.

## Design Solution Overview

The Context Management System (CMS) provides:

### 1. **Intelligent Context Pipeline**
- **Context Filtering**: Relevance-based file selection using multi-factor scoring
- **Token Budget Management**: Dynamic allocation optimized for agent types and TDD phases  
- **Content Compression**: Semantic-preserving compression for large codebases
- **Agent Memory**: Persistent storage of decisions and artifacts across phases
- **Context Handoffs**: Efficient transfer of work products between TDD phases

### 2. **Core Architecture Components**
- **Context Manager**: Central coordination of context preparation
- **Context Filter**: Multi-factor relevance scoring and file filtering
- **Token Calculator**: Budget allocation and usage optimization
- **Context Compressor**: Intelligent content compression with semantic preservation
- **Agent Memory**: Persistent context storage and retrieval
- **Context Index**: Searchable codebase indexing and dependency analysis

### 3. **Advanced Features**
- **Predictive Caching**: Anticipate future context needs based on TDD patterns
- **Cross-Story Context**: Manage context isolation between parallel TDD cycles
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-2-second context preparation for typical tasks
- **Automatic Tuning**: Self-optimizing parameters based on usage patterns

## Key Innovations

### Multi-Factor Relevance Scoring
```
Relevance Score = 0.40 × Direct Mention + 0.25 × Dependencies + 
                  0.20 × Historical + 0.10 × Semantic + 0.05 × TDD Phase
```

### Adaptive Content Compression
- **Python Code**: AST-based compression preserving structure and key logic
- **Test Files**: Preserve assertions and test intent while compressing setup
- **Documentation**: Extract key requirements and specifications
- **Dynamic Strategy**: Compression level adapts to token budget constraints

### Token Budget Optimization
- **Agent-Specific Allocation**: Different budget distributions for Design, QA, Code, and Data agents
- **TDD Phase Awareness**: Allocation adjustments based on current TDD phase needs
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Redistribute unused allocations to components that need more

### Intelligent Caching
- **Pattern-Based Prediction**: Predict future context needs based on TDD workflows
- **Eviction Optimization**: Multi-factor scoring for intelligent cache eviction
- **Pre-warming**: Background preparation of likely future contexts
