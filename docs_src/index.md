## Dual State Machine Workflow

The system operates two coordinated state machines for complete TDD-Scrum integration:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IDLE
    IDLE --> BACKLOG_READY : /epic
    BACKLOG_READY --> SPRINT_PLANNED : /sprint plan
    SPRINT_PLANNED --> SPRINT_ACTIVE : /sprint start
    SPRINT_ACTIVE --> SPRINT_REVIEW : tasks complete
    SPRINT_REVIEW --> IDLE : /feedback
    SPRINT_ACTIVE --> SPRINT_PAUSED : /sprint pause
    SPRINT_PAUSED --> SPRINT_ACTIVE : /sprint resume
    SPRINT_ACTIVE --> BLOCKED : CI fails 3×
    BLOCKED --> SPRINT_ACTIVE : /suggest_fix
```

### TDD State Machine (Per Story)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DESIGN
    DESIGN --> TEST_RED : specs complete
    TEST_RED --> CODE_GREEN : tests failing
    CODE_GREEN --> REFACTOR : tests passing
    REFACTOR --> COMMIT : quality gates met
    COMMIT --> [*] : story complete
    
    REFACTOR --> CODE_GREEN : tests broken
    CODE_GREEN --> TEST_RED : need more tests
    TEST_RED --> DESIGN : requirements unclear
```

**Key TDD Commands:**
- `/tdd overview` - Monitor all active TDD cycles
- `/tdd status AUTH-1` - Check specific story progress
- `/tdd review_cycle AUTH-1` - Request human review
- `/tdd metrics` - View TDD performance data
