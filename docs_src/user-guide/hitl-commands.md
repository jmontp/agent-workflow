# üí¨ HITL Commands - Discord Bot Reference

> **Complete Discord slash command reference for AI agent control, workflow management, and human-in-the-loop operations**

**Discord command guide** for controlling AI agents, managing sprints, approving tasks, and orchestrating TDD workflows. All commands work in Discord channels with slash command interface. These commands provide Human-In-The-Loop control over the dual state machine orchestration process with integrated TDD workflows.

!!! tip "Quick Command Discovery"
    Use `/state` in Discord at any time to see available commands for your current workflow state.

### üìã Project Management

=== "Epic Definition"

    **`/epic "<description>"`**
    
    Define a new high-level initiative.
    
    !!! example "Example"
        ```
        /epic "Build authentication system with OAuth2 support"

```
> Orchestrator returns proposed stories `AUTH-1`, `AUTH-2`.

```bash
/approve AUTH-1 AUTH-2
```

## Escalation Policy (Research Mode)
1. The Orchestrator escalates after **three consecutive CI failures**.
2. Security-critical code requires explicit human approval.
3. Agents time-box tasks to **30 min**; longer tasks trigger a status ping.

_This lightweight command set keeps you focused on big-picture direction while agents handle the details._

## State Awareness & Invalid Commands
The orchestrator enforces a finite-state machine (see `command_state_machine.md`).

* Use `/state` at any time to:
  1. View the **current state** (e.g., `SPRINT_ACTIVE`).
  2. Click **Allowed Commands** ‚Äì shows only the verbs valid right now.
  3. Click **Diagram** ‚Äì in-chat SVG of the full state chart.
  4. Click **Matrix** ‚Äì raw command‚Üístate table.

If you issue a command that is **not legal** for the current state, the bot replies with an error message:

**Warning:** Command `/sprint plan` is not allowed now (state: **SPRINT_ACTIVE**). Try `/sprint status`.

No action is taken until a valid command is sent.
