        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
    
    return sequence

# Example usage
result = calculate_fibonacci(10)
print(f"First 10 Fibonacci numbers: {result}")

### Code with Syntax Highlighting

```javascript
// Theme selector implementation
class ThemeSelector {
  constructor() {
    this.themes = [
      { id: 'github', name: 'GitHub', colors: ['#0969da', '#f6f8fa'] },
      { id: 'gitlab', name: 'GitLab', colors: ['#fc6d26', '#fafafa'] },
      // ... more themes
    ];
    this.init();
  }
  
  applyTheme(themeId) {
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', themeId);
    this.saveTheme(themeId);
  }
}
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Open theme selector | Click "Themes" button |
| Navigate themes | ++arrow-up++ / ++arrow-down++ |
| Select theme | ++enter++ or ++space++ |
| Close selector | ++escape++ |

### Math and Formulas

When using MathJax, formulas adapt to the theme colors:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

The color scheme affects the rendering of mathematical expressions to maintain readability.

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Custom Properties

Each theme uses CSS custom properties for instant switching:

```css
[data-theme="github"] {
  --md-primary-fg-color: #0969da;
  --md-default-bg-color: #ffffff;
  --md-default-fg-color: #1f2328;
  /* ... more properties */
}
```

### JavaScript API

The theme selector provides a simple API:

```javascript
// Get current theme
const theme = window.themeSelector.getCurrentTheme();

// Set specific theme
window.themeSelector.setTheme('dracula');

// Listen for changes
document.addEventListener('themeChanged', (event) => {
  console.log('New theme:', event.detail.themeId);
});
```

- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and announcements
- **High Contrast**: Support for users with visual impairments
