## üìà Progress Tracking

### Current Analysis Results

**Top Priority Modules (Highest Impact):**
1. `agent_pool.py` - 0.0% coverage, 486 missing lines (HIGH effort)
2. `mock_agent.py` - 0.0% coverage, 110 missing lines (HIGH effort)
3. `conflict_resolver.py` - 0.0% coverage, 457 missing lines (HIGH effort)
4. `manager.py` - 0.0% coverage, 229 missing lines (HIGH effort)
5. `context_config.py` - 0.0% coverage, 367 missing lines (HIGH effort)

**Effort Distribution:**
- Quick Wins (‚â§5 lines): 0 modules
- Medium Effort (6-15 lines): 0 modules
- Major Effort (>15 lines): 39 modules

## üéØ Compliance Goals

### Tier System
- **TIER 1**: 0-59% coverage (Initial phase)
- **TIER 2**: 60-79% coverage (Moderate coverage)
- **TIER 3**: 80-89% coverage (Significant progress) ‚Üê **CURRENT**
- **TIER 4**: 90-94% coverage (Near compliance)
- **TIER 5**: 95%+ coverage (Government Audit Compliant) ‚Üê **TARGET**

### Compliance Requirements
- **Target Coverage**: 95.0% across all lib modules
- **Government Standard**: TIER 5 compliance
- **Module Threshold**: Each module must achieve ‚â•95% coverage
- **Current Gap**: 80.6 percentage points

## üîÑ Usage Workflow

### 1. Daily Monitoring
```bash
# Quick status check
python3 compliance_summary.py

# Detailed progress review
python3 monitor_compliance.py
```

### 2. Weekly Analysis
```bash
# Full compliance analysis
python3 audit_compliance_tracker.py
```

### 3. Development Integration
```bash
# Before committing changes
python3 compliance_summary.py

# After implementing tests
python3 audit_compliance_tracker.py
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disk Space Management

The system includes automatic disk space monitoring:
- **95-96%**: Warning mode, minimal operations
- **97%+**: Critical mode, suspend heavy operations
- **Current Status**: 97% - CRITICAL

**Safety Features:**
- Automatic disk usage checks
- Lightweight operation modes
- Immediate cleanup of temporary files
- Resource usage optimization

## üìã Action Items

### Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint)
1. Focus on modules with 0% coverage
2. Target quick wins first (modules with <10 missing lines)
3. Implement systematic testing approach
4. Monitor progress weekly

### Strategic Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Address zero-coverage modules
2. **Phase 2**: Boost modules to 80%+ coverage
3. **Phase 3**: Fine-tune to achieve 95%+ compliance
4. **Phase 4**: Maintain compliance through CI/CD

## üö® Critical Alerts

- **Disk Space**: Currently at 97% - immediate attention required
- **Coverage Gap**: 80.6 percentage points to compliance
- **Module Count**: 39 modules need significant work
- **Estimated Effort**: 5,576 hours of testing work

## üí° Recommendations

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Clean up disk space to enable full testing
2. Focus on highest-impact modules first
3. Implement basic test coverage for zero-coverage modules
4. Set up automated monitoring

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. Systematic approach to reach 80% overall coverage
2. Module-by-module compliance push
3. Integrate tracking into development workflow
4. Regular compliance reviews

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. Achieve TIER 5 (95%+) government compliance
2. Maintain compliance through automated testing
3. Documentation and process standardization
4. Audit-ready reporting system
