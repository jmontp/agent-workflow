## Quick Start

If you only have 30 minutes, read:
1. The Vision document (01) for the big picture
2. The Context Manager V1 Plan (04) for immediate next steps
3. The Agent Specifications (05) to understand the system components

## Project Status

- ‚úÖ Minimal state machine demo (4 files)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive research completed
- ‚úÖ Documentation organized
- üîÑ Next: Implement Context Manager v1 (Week 1)
- ‚è≥ Then: Add Documentation Agent (Week 2-3)
- ‚è≥ Future: Build remaining agents

## Key Concepts

- **Bootstrap Approach**: The Context Manager helps build itself
- **Context-First Design**: Everything flows through context
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, enhance based on real usage
- **Compliance Ready**: Built for FDA/regulatory requirements from day one
