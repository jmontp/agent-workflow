## Historical Context

This document originally contained the comprehensive design thinking that led to Context Manager v1. It captured:

- The evolution from initial ideas to concrete design
- Key design decisions and their rationale
- The TDD approach and test planning
- UI integration concepts
- The 4-week development schedule

The design process revealed important insights:
1. Start simple with JSON storage
2. Use Python dataclasses for type safety
3. Implement bootstrap features from day one
4. Build with medical device compliance in mind
5. Create clear migration paths for future enhancements

All technical content has been reorganized into the focused documentation linked above, providing cleaner separation between the historical journey and actionable implementation details.
