# Project Evolution Guide

This guide presents a structured path from vision to implementation for building an autonomous software engineering company.

## ðŸ“š Reading Order

Read these documents in sequence for the best understanding:

### 1. [Vision](01_AUTONOMOUS_SOFTWARE_COMPANY_VISION.md) (30 min)
**The Big Picture** - Can one person run multiple autonomous software companies?
- 4 levels of automation (Today â†’ 1-2 years â†’ 3-5 years â†’ Theoretical)
- Scalability at each level (1-3 â†’ 5-10 â†’ Dozens â†’ Infinite companies)
- Key enabling technologies

### 2. [Implementation Roadmap](02_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) (20 min)
**The Bootstrap Strategy** - How the Context Manager builds itself
- Why Context Manager first (not agents)
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Stage-by-stage development plan

### 3. [Context Manager Development Guide](03_CONTEXT_MANAGER_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) (25 min)
**Technical Depth** - Where to stop and why
- Context Engineering principles (Atoms â†’ Neural Fields)
- What to build now vs. defer
- Optimal stopping point before agents

### 4. [Context Manager V1 Plan](04_CONTEXT_MANAGER_V1_PLAN.md) (15 min)
**Week 1 Deliverable** - Concrete implementation plan
- ~150 lines of code to start
- Bootstrap features (logs its own development)
- Integration with existing demo

### 5. [Agent Specifications](05_AGENT_SPECIFICATIONS_EXPANDED.md) (20 min)
**System Components** - All agents including medical device needs
- Documentation Agent (early priority for FDA)
- Core software agents
- Future hardware agents
- Implementation phases

## ðŸ“Š Project Timeline

- **Week 1**: Context Manager v1 (Document #4)
- **Week 2-3**: Documentation Agent 
- **Week 4-6**: Core agents (Design, Code, QA)
- **Month 2-3**: Level 1 system complete
- **Year 1-2**: Level 2 autonomous operation
- **Year 3-5**: Level 3 emergent systems

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insight

The Context Manager isn't just infrastructureâ€”it's the first "agent" that helps build everything else. By using it to track its own development, we create a self-improving foundation for the entire system.
