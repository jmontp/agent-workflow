### 4. QA Agent
**Role**: Testing and quality assurance
- Writes comprehensive test suites
- Validates requirements are met
- Performs security testing
- Documents test results for compliance

### 5. Data Agent
**Role**: Analytics and insights
- Tracks development metrics
- Generates progress reports
- Analyzes patterns for optimization
- Creates compliance audit trails

## Phase 2: Domain-Specific Agents (6-12 months)

### 6. Regulatory Agent
**Role**: Compliance and approval management
- Tracks FDA/CE/ISO requirements
- Manages 510(k) submissions
- Ensures design controls compliance
- Interfaces with regulatory databases

### 7. Integration Agent
**Role**: System integration specialist
- Manages hardware-software interfaces
- Coordinates between domain agents
- Validates end-to-end functionality
- Documents integration protocols

### 8. Security Agent
**Role**: Security and privacy compliance
- Implements security best practices
- Manages HIPAA compliance
- Performs vulnerability assessments
- Documents security measures

## Phase 3: Hardware-Specific Agents (12+ months)

### 9. Mechanical Design Agent
**Role**: CAD and mechanical engineering
- Creates 3D models and drawings
- Performs FEA/stress analysis
- Optimizes for manufacturability
- Manages BOM and specifications

### 10. Electronics Agent
**Role**: PCB and circuit design
- Designs schematics and layouts
- Selects components
- Manages power budgets
- Creates manufacturing files

### 11. Firmware Agent
**Role**: Embedded systems programming
- Writes low-level drivers
- Implements real-time control
- Manages hardware interfaces
- Optimizes for power/performance

### 12. Controls Agent
**Role**: Control systems and algorithms
- Designs control algorithms
- Implements safety systems
- Tunes parameters
- Validates stability

## Phase 4: Specialized Domain Agents (Future)

### 13. Clinical Agent
**Role**: Clinical trial management
- Designs trial protocols
- Manages patient data
- Tracks adverse events
- Generates clinical reports

### 14. Manufacturing Agent
**Role**: Production planning
- Creates manufacturing procedures
- Manages supply chain
- Tracks quality metrics
- Optimizes production costs

### 15. Business Agent
**Role**: Business strategy and planning
- Market analysis
- Pricing strategies
- Partnership evaluation
- ROI calculations

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Documentation-Centric Workflow
```
User Story → Design Agent → Documentation Agent → Code Agent → 
QA Agent → Documentation Agent → Regulatory Agent
```

The Documentation Agent acts as a "scribe" throughout the process, ensuring every decision and implementation is captured for compliance and knowledge management.

### Compliance-First Development
For medical devices, the workflow emphasizes documentation and traceability:

1. **Requirement** → Documentation Agent (captures in traceability matrix)
2. **Design** → Design Agent + Documentation Agent (design controls)
3. **Implementation** → Code Agent + Documentation Agent (code documentation)
4. **Verification** → QA Agent + Documentation Agent (test reports)
5. **Validation** → Integration Agent + Documentation Agent (system validation)

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Weeks 1-6)
1. Context Manager (foundation)
2. Documentation Agent (compliance critical)
3. Design Agent (specifications)

### Short-term (Weeks 7-12)
4. Code Agent (implementation)
5. QA Agent (verification)

### Medium-term (Months 3-6)
6. Data Agent (insights)
7. Regulatory Agent (approvals)
8. Integration Agent (system-level)

### Long-term (6+ months)
9-15. Domain-specific agents as needed

## Key Design Principles

1. **Documentation First**: Every agent interaction is documented
2. **Compliance by Design**: Regulatory requirements built into workflows
3. **Modular Architecture**: Agents can be added without disrupting existing ones
4. **Context Awareness**: All agents share context through Context Manager
5. **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions require human approval

This expanded specification ensures the system can evolve from pure software development to complex hardware-software medical devices while maintaining compliance and quality throughout.
