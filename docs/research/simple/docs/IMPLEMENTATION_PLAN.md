# Implementation Plan: Context-Driven Agent Workflow

Based on Context Engineering principles and our dependency analysis, here's our implementation roadmap.

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### 1. Define Core Context Schema
Create `context_schema.json` based on context.json standard:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "schema_type": "agent-workflow-context",
  "context": {
    "project": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "string",
      "type": "software|documentation|analysis"
    },
    "workflow": {
      "state": "IDLE|PLANNING|BACKLOG_READY|SPRINT_ACTIVE|BLOCKED|SPRINT_REVIEW",
      "tdd_state": "DESIGN|TEST_RED|TEST_GREEN|REFACTOR",
      "transitions": []
    },
    "agents": {
      "active": [],
      "history": []
    },
    "memory": {
      "immediate": {},
      "working": {},
      "learned": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Implement Context Manager
Start with a simple Python implementation:

```python
# context_manager.py
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.immediate_context = {}  # Current operation
        self.working_context = {}    # Current session
        self.boundaries = {}         # Security rules
        
    def flow_context(self, from_component, to_component, context):
        """Route context with boundaries and filtering"""
        pass
        
    def prune_context(self, strategy="temporal"):
        """Remove irrelevant context"""
        pass
```

### 3. Enhance State Machines
Add context awareness to existing state machines:

```python
# Enhanced from current app.py
@dataclass
class ContextAwareStateMachine:
    current_state: Enum
    transitions: Dict[Enum, list]
    context_requirements: Dict[Enum, list]
    context_outputs: Dict[Enum, list]
    context_manager: ContextManager
    
    def transition(self, new_state: Enum, context: dict) -> bool:
        """Transition with context validation"""
        if not self.validate_context(new_state, context):
            return False
        # ... existing transition logic
```

## Short-term Goals (Weeks 2-3)

### 1. Agent Base Class with Context
```python
class ContextAwareAgent:
    def __init__(self, agent_type: str, context_manager: ContextManager):
        self.agent_type = agent_type
        self.context_manager = context_manager
        self.context_boundaries = self.load_boundaries()
        
    def process(self, context: dict) -> dict:
        """Process with context awareness"""
        filtered_context = self.filter_incoming_context(context)
        result = self.execute(filtered_context)
        return self.prepare_output_context(result)
```

### 2. Storage Layer Foundation
- Set up Redis for immediate/working context
- PostgreSQL schema for historical context
- Basic CRUD operations for context persistence

### 3. Simple Web UI Updates
- Display current context state
- Show context flow between agents
- Add context debugging panel

## Medium-term Goals (Weeks 4-6)

### 1. Implement Core Agents
Following context engineering principles:
- **Design Agent**: Context in = requirements, Context out = specifications
- **Code Agent**: Context in = specs, Context out = implementation
- **QA Agent**: Context in = code+specs, Context out = test results
- **Data Agent**: Context in = all data, Context out = insights

### 2. Context Flow Visualization
- Real-time context flow diagram
- Token usage monitoring
- Context boundary violations alerts

### 3. Basic Learning System
- Store successful patterns
- Simple pattern matching
- Context suggestion system

## Long-term Vision (Months 2-3)

### 1. Advanced Context Features
- Semantic search over historical context
- Cross-project pattern learning
- Automatic context pruning optimization
- Emergence detection

### 2. Multi-Project Orchestration
- Project context isolation
- Cross-project insights (with boundaries)
- Resource optimization across projects

### 3. Production Readiness
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Deployment automation

## Critical Path Items

### Must Have (MVP)
1. Context Manager core functionality
2. Enhanced state machines with context
3. Basic agent implementation (at least Design + Code)
4. Simple persistence (Redis + PostgreSQL)
5. Web UI showing context state

### Should Have (V1)
1. All five agent types
2. Context flow visualization
3. Basic pattern learning
4. Context pruning strategies
5. Multi-project support

### Nice to Have (V2)
1. Advanced semantic search
2. Emergence detection
3. Auto-optimization
4. Plugin system for custom agents
5. Context prediction

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Context Explosion**: Implement aggressive pruning from day 1
2. **Token Limits**: Monitor usage, implement summarization
3. **Performance**: Use caching, optimize queries
4. **Complexity**: Start simple, iterate based on metrics

### Architectural Risks
1. **Over-engineering**: Follow progressive enhancement
2. **Tight Coupling**: Use clear interfaces and boundaries
3. **Security**: Implement boundaries early
4. **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success (Context Foundation)
- [ ] Context flows successfully between components
- [ ] State transitions include context validation
- [ ] Basic persistence works
- [ ] UI displays context state

### Phase 2 Success (Agent Integration)

## Development Approach

### 1. Test-Driven Development
- Write context flow tests first
- Test boundaries and security
- Test state machine transitions
- Test agent interactions

### 2. Incremental Enhancement
- Start with minimal context
- Add fields as needed
- Measure impact of each addition
- Prune unnecessary complexity

### 3. Continuous Monitoring
- Log all context operations
- Track token usage
- Monitor performance
- Gather user feedback

## Tooling Requirements

### Development Tools
- Python 3.9+ (for type hints)
- Redis (for fast context)
- PostgreSQL (for structured data)
- Pytest (for testing)
- FastAPI (for better async handling)

### Monitoring Tools
- Prometheus (metrics)
- Grafana (dashboards)
- OpenTelemetry (tracing)
- ELK Stack (logging)

## Team Structure (if applicable)

### Core Team Roles
1. **Context Architect**: Overall system design
2. **Agent Developer**: Implement agents
3. **Infrastructure**: Storage and deployment
4. **UI/UX**: Visualization and interfaces
5. **QA/Security**: Testing and boundaries

## Conclusion

This plan incorporates Context Engineering principles while maintaining practicality. The progressive approach allows us to start simple and evolve based on real usage patterns. The focus on context as a first-class citizen will create a more intelligent and maintainable system.

**Next Action**: Create `context_schema.json` and implement basic ContextManager class.
