  - Validation methodology
  - Clinical performance indicators
  - Failure case analysis
- **Update mechanism documentation** (if using PCCP)

### 2.2 Documentation Depth by Safety Classification

**Class A (Low Risk)**
- Basic architecture documentation
- Essential verification records
- Simplified risk analysis

**Class B (Moderate Risk)**

## 3. Balancing Traceability and Agility

### 3.1 Practical Traceability Strategies

#### Automated Traceability
- Use tools that automatically link requirements to code
- Implement CI/CD pipelines that enforce traceability
- Version control integration with requirement management

#### Risk-Based Documentation
- Focus detailed documentation on high-risk components
- Use lightweight documentation for low-risk features
- Implement "documentation debt" tracking

#### Agile-Friendly Approaches
- **Living Documentation**: Update docs with each sprint
- **Incremental DHF**: Build Design History File progressively
- **Test-Driven Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications
- **Model-Based Design**: Use models that auto-generate documentation

### 3.2 PCCP for Post-Market Agility

The Predetermined Change Control Plan (PCCP) is FDA's solution for AI/ML agility:

**Allowed Under PCCP**:
- Algorithm retraining with new data
- Performance improvements
- Bug fixes and security updates
- UI/UX improvements (within bounds)

**Requires New Submission**:
- Changes to intended use
- New clinical indications
- Significant architecture changes
- Safety-critical modifications not in PCCP

## 4. Maintaining Compliance Without Crushing Innovation

### 4.1 Innovation-Friendly Compliance Strategies

#### Modular Documentation
- Separate stable components from rapidly evolving ones
- Document interfaces thoroughly, implementations minimally
- Use configuration management for flexibility

#### Risk-Based Innovation Gates
- **Low Risk Features**: Rapid iteration with post-hoc documentation
- **Medium Risk**: Concurrent documentation with development
- **High Risk**: Full documentation before implementation

#### Leveraging FDA's New AI/ML Framework
1. **Use PCCP Effectively**:
   - Plan for common AI updates in initial submission
   - Include broad modification categories
   - Define clear performance boundaries

2. **Performance Monitoring as Innovation Enabler**:
   - Real-world data collection plans
   - Automated performance tracking
   - Proactive issue identification

### 4.2 Documentation Efficiency Techniques

#### Templates and Automation
- Standardized templates for common documents
- Automated document generation from code
- API documentation tools for interfaces
- Automated test report generation

#### Single Source of Truth
- Centralized requirement management
- Integrated ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) tools
- Version-controlled documentation
- Automated traceability reports

#### Lean Documentation Principles
- Document decisions, not details
- Focus on "why" not just "what"
- Use visual documentation where possible
- Eliminate redundant documentation
