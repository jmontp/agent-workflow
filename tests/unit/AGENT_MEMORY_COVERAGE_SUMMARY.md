- JSON serialization/deserialization errors
- Cache TTL edge cases
- Directory iteration edge cases
- Complex file path sanitization
- Concurrent operations advanced scenarios
- Analysis edge cases with empty/malformed data
- Memory update attribute handling

### 3. test_agent_memory_final_coverage.py (14 tests)
Final coverage push targeting specific uncovered lines:
- Timestamp update verification
- Cache expiration cleanup
- Successful pattern filtering logic
- Pattern analysis average calculations
- Memory creation in specialized methods
- Directory creation during storage
- Complex workflow scenarios

## Files Modified
- `tests/unit/test_agent_memory.py` (existing - maintained)
- `tests/unit/test_agent_memory_enhanced_coverage.py` (new)
- `tests/unit/test_agent_memory_final_coverage.py` (new)
- `tests/unit/AGENT_MEMORY_COVERAGE_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Testing Strategy
The three-tier testing approach ensures:
1. **Base functionality** is thoroughly tested
2. **Edge cases** and error conditions are covered
3. **Complex scenarios** and integration patterns work correctly

All tests use proper isolation with temporary directories and comprehensive cleanup to prevent file system pollution during testing.

## Execution
Run all agent memory tests:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_agent_memory*.py -v
```

Results: 80 tests passing, achieving target coverage for TIER 4 compliance.
