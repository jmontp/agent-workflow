# Context Collection Enhancement Roadmap

## Executive Summary

The Context Manager's context collection system has completed Phase 1, implementing Claude-based task analysis with intelligent relevance scoring and multi-stage collection pipelines. The system currently provides effective context gathering for agent tasks while maintaining token efficiency. Future phases will enhance performance through semantic caching, multi-agent optimization, and advanced intelligence features.

## Phase 1: Claude-Based Task Analysis (✅ Completed)

### Implemented Features
- **Task Analysis**: Claude analyzes task descriptions to extract key concepts and requirements
- **Multi-Stage Collection Pipeline**:
  1. Recent contexts (30% token allocation)
  2. Concept matches from knowledge graph
  3. Function/class matches from code
  4. Description-based matches
  5. Folder descriptions for project structure
- **Relevance Re-ranking**: Dynamic scoring based on task requirements
- **Token Optimization**: Balanced allocation with smart truncation and redistribution
- **Auto-loading**: Project index loads automatically on Context Manager initialization

### Key Components
```python
# Current implementation structure
collect_context_for_task(task_description, max_tokens=100000)
├── analyze_task_with_claude()  # Extract concepts and requirements
├── collect_recent_contexts()   # Historical relevance
├── collect_concept_matches()   # Knowledge graph traversal
├── collect_code_matches()      # Function/class relevance
├── collect_doc_matches()       # Documentation search
└── optimize_tokens()           # Smart allocation
```

### Success Metrics Achieved
- Average context relevance score: 0.85+ for targeted tasks
- Token utilization efficiency: 95%+ of allocated tokens used
- Collection latency: <2 seconds for typical tasks
- Agent satisfaction: Swiss Army Knife agent successfully uses context

## Phase 2: Semantic Caching with Vector Embeddings (Q1 2025)

### Objectives
- Reduce Claude API calls by 70% through intelligent caching
- Enable similarity-based context retrieval
- Improve response time to <500ms for cached queries

### Technical Implementation
1. **Embedding Generation**
   - Use sentence-transformers for local embeddings
   - Store embeddings in FAISS or ChromaDB
   - Index all code, docs, and historical contexts

2. **Semantic Cache Layer**
   ```python
   class SemanticCache:
       def get_similar_contexts(task_embedding, threshold=0.8)
       def cache_task_analysis(task, concepts, embeddings)
       def invalidate_on_code_change(affected_files)
   ```

3. **Hybrid Retrieval**
   - Combine semantic search with keyword matching
   - Use BM25 + vector similarity for optimal results

### Risk Mitigation
- Fallback to Claude analysis if cache miss
- Regular cache validation against actual results
- Monitoring for embedding drift over time

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent Context Optimization (Q2 2025)

### Objectives
- Specialize context collection per agent type
- Create reusable context templates
- Enable cross-agent context sharing

### Technical Implementation
1. **Agent-Specific Templates**
   ```python
   class ContextTemplate:
       agent_type: str
       required_sections: List[str]
       token_allocation: Dict[str, float]
       relevance_weights: Dict[str, float]
   ```

2. **Cross-Agent Context Sharing**
   - Shared context pool for collaborative tasks
   - Event-driven updates when agents modify code
   - Context inheritance for sub-tasks

3. **Dynamic Optimization**
   - Learn optimal allocations from agent feedback
   - A/B testing for template variations
   - Automatic adjustment based on task success

### Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in redundant context collection
- 90%+ agent task completion rate
- <100ms context handoff between agents

## Phase 4: Advanced Intelligence Features (Q3-Q4 2025)

### Objectives
- Multi-turn context refinement based on agent feedback
- Predictive context pre-loading
- Self-improving relevance algorithms

### Technical Implementation
1. **Interactive Refinement**
   ```python
   class ContextRefinement:
       def request_clarification(agent_feedback)
       def expand_context(specific_areas)
       def prune_irrelevant_sections()
   ```

2. **Predictive Loading**
   - Pattern recognition for task sequences
   - Pre-compute likely next contexts
   - Background indexing of modified files

3. **ML-Based Relevance**
   - Train on successful task completions
   - Learn project-specific relevance patterns
   - Continuous model updates

### Advanced Features
- Context explanation generation
- Automatic summarization for large contexts
