## Troubleshooting Wisdom to Preserve

### From tools/visualizer/CLAUDE.md

Critical troubleshooting section about "Changes Not Reflecting After Code Updates":
```markdown
### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Changes Not Reflecting After Code Updates

**Problem**: After making code changes to the visualizer, running `aw web` shows old version

**Root Causes**:
1. **Python Package Installation Mode**: Package installed in site-packages instead of editable mode
2. **Browser Cache**: Browser serving cached JavaScript/CSS files

**Solution**:
[Include full solution steps]
```

This MUST be preserved in user troubleshooting guide.

### From Various Implementation Summaries

Common patterns to extract:
1. **"Gotchas" sections** - Unexpected behaviors discovered
2. **"Lessons Learned" sections** - What worked/didn't work
3. **Performance measurements** - Actual numbers achieved
4. **Security considerations** - Vulnerabilities found and fixed
5. **Integration challenges** - How systems were made to work together

## Validation Checklist

Before archiving any file, ensure:

- [ ] All troubleshooting solutions extracted
- [ ] Performance metrics preserved
- [ ] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] Security considerations captured
- [ ] Integration patterns recorded
- [ ] Lessons learned incorporated
- [ ] Code examples updated
- [ ] Cross-references maintained

## Special Handling

### CLAUDE.md Files
These files contain critical context for AI assistants. When extracting:
1. Preserve all warning sections
2. Keep navigation helpers
3. Maintain troubleshooting sections
4. Update with new file locations

### Compliance Documents
These have legal/audit value:
1. Archive in `docs_src/archive/compliance/` 
2. Maintain full content unchanged
3. Add archive date and reason
4. Keep accessible but separate

### Test Reports
Consolidate but preserve:
1. Baseline metrics
2. Test methodologies
3. Coverage achievements
4. Critical test cases

## Post-Extraction Verification

After extracting content:
1. Search for TODO/FIXME comments
2. Check for hardcoded values to parameterize
3. Verify all links still work
4. Ensure examples are current
5. Update any outdated commands

This extraction process ensures no valuable knowledge is lost during the documentation migration.
