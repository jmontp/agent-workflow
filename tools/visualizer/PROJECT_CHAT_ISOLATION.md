# Project-Specific Chat Isolation Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides complete project-specific chat isolation for the Discord web interface, ensuring that chat history, commands, and user interactions are properly separated by project context.

## Key Features

### 1. Chat History Isolation
- **Per-Project Storage**: Each project maintains its own chat history using a `Map` data structure
- **Local Persistence**: Chat history is saved to `localStorage` with project-specific keys
- **Seamless Switching**: When switching projects, chat history is automatically saved/loaded
- **Capacity Management**: Each project maintains up to 100 messages with automatic cleanup

### 2. WebSocket Room Management
- **Project Rooms**: Each project gets its own WebSocket room (`project_{projectName}`)
- **Automatic Room Joining**: Users automatically join the appropriate room when switching projects
- **Isolated Broadcasting**: Messages, typing indicators, and presence events are scoped to project rooms
- **Session Tracking**: Server tracks which project each user is currently active in

### 3. Command Context Isolation
- **Project-Aware Commands**: All commands include project context and execute in the correct project scope
- **Command History**: Separate command history maintained per project (up to 20 commands each)
- **Autocomplete Context**: Command autocomplete is project-aware and shows relevant suggestions

### 4. User Session Management
- **Session Tracking**: Each user session is tracked with current project context
- **Reconnection Handling**: Users reconnect to their last active project
- **Presence Management**: User presence is managed per project room
- **Clean Disconnection**: Proper cleanup when users leave projects

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (discord-chat.js)

#### New Data Structures
```javascript
// Project-specific chat isolation
this.projectChatHistory = new Map(); // project_name -> messages array
this.projectCommandHistory = new Map(); // project_name -> commands array
this.currentProjectRoom = null;
this.projectTypingUsers = new Map(); // project_name -> Set of typing users
```

#### Key Methods
- `switchProject(newProject, oldProject)` - Handles project switching with state preservation
- `saveProjectData()` / `loadProjectData()` - localStorage persistence
- `joinProjectRoom(projectName)` / `leaveProjectRoom(projectName)` - WebSocket room management
- `handleProjectMessage(messageData)` - Project-aware message handling
- `displayProjectMessages(messages)` - Project-specific UI updates

#### External API
```javascript
// Public methods for integration
chat.setProject(projectName)          // Switch to project
chat.getProject()                     // Get current project
chat.getProjectHistory(projectName)   // Get project's chat history
chat.clearProjectHistory(projectName) // Clear project's chat history
```

### Backend (app.py)

#### New Data Structures
```python
# Project-specific chat data structures
project_chat_history = {}      # project_name -> list of messages
project_user_sessions = {}     # user_id -> {'project': project_name, 'session_id': session_id}
project_typing_users = {}      # project_name -> set of user_ids
user_project_rooms = {}        # user_id -> project_name (current room)
```

#### Enhanced WebSocket Handlers
- `handle_chat_command()` - Project-aware message processing
- `handle_join_project_room()` - Project room management
- `handle_leave_project_room()` - Clean project room exit
- `handle_switch_project()` - Seamless project switching
- `handle_start_typing()` / `handle_stop_typing()` - Project-scoped typing indicators

#### Message Structure
All messages now include project context:
```python
{
    "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
    "user_id": user_id,
    "username": username,
    "message": message,
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "type": "user|bot|system",
    "project_name": project_name  # NEW: Project context
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Project Switching
```javascript
// Switch to a different project
chat.setProject('my-new-project');

// Get current project
const currentProject = chat.getProject();

// Check project history
const history = chat.getProjectHistory('my-project');
console.log(`Project has ${history.length} messages`);
```

### Integration with Visualizer
```javascript
// Listen for project changes from visualizer
document.addEventListener('projectChanged', (event) => {
    chat.setProject(event.detail.newProject);
});

// Or integrate directly with visualizer instance
window.visualizer.onProjectChange = (newProject, oldProject) => {
    chat.setProject(newProject);
};
```

### Manual Project Management
```javascript
// Clear specific project history
chat.clearProjectHistory('old-project');

// Programmatically switch projects
chat.switchProject('project-b', 'project-a');
```

## Testing

### Test Interface
A comprehensive test interface is provided in `test_project_isolation.html` that:
- Simulates two projects simultaneously
- Demonstrates message isolation between projects
- Shows project-specific typing indicators
- Validates localStorage persistence
- Tests WebSocket room management

### Test Scenarios
1. **Message Isolation**: Messages sent to Project A don't appear in Project B
2. **Command History**: Command history is maintained separately per project
3. **Typing Indicators**: Typing indicators only show for users in the same project
4. **Persistence**: Chat history survives page refreshes and is restored correctly
5. **Room Management**: Users properly join/leave project-specific WebSocket rooms

## Integration Points

### With State Visualizer
The chat isolation integrates seamlessly with the existing state visualizer:
- Project changes trigger chat switches automatically
- State changes are highlighted in the correct project context
- Multiple projects can be monitored simultaneously

### With Command Processor
Commands are executed with full project context:
- Project name is passed to command handlers
- Command results are scoped to the correct project
- State changes affect only the target project

### With Collaboration System
The isolation works with the collaboration framework:
- User permissions are project-specific
- Collaboration sessions are scoped to projects
- Multi-user interactions are properly isolated

## Security Considerations

### Data Isolation
- Complete separation of project data in memory and storage
- No cross-project data leakage
- Secure room-based communication

### Access Control
- Users can only access chat history for projects they've joined
- WebSocket rooms provide natural access boundaries
- Project switching requires explicit user action

### Session Management
- Session tracking prevents unauthorized project access
- Clean session cleanup on disconnection
- Proper room management prevents message leakage

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of old messages (100 per project)
- Efficient Map-based storage for O(1) project lookups
- Lazy loading of project history

### Network Efficiency
- Room-based broadcasting reduces unnecessary network traffic
- Only relevant users receive project-specific messages
- Minimal overhead for project context

### Storage Optimization
- Compressed localStorage format
- Periodic cleanup of old project data
- Efficient serialization/deserialization

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Project-specific notification settings
- Advanced project filtering and search
- Project analytics and usage tracking
- Integration with project management systems

### Potential Improvements
- Real-time project activity indicators
- Project-specific themes and customization
- Enhanced collaboration features per project
- Advanced permission models

## Migration Guide

### From Non-Isolated Chat
Existing chat implementations can be migrated by:
1. Adding project context to existing messages
2. Updating WebSocket handlers to include project information
3. Implementing the new frontend methods
4. Testing with the provided test interface

### Backwards Compatibility
The implementation maintains backwards compatibility:
- Existing messages work with default project context
- Non-project-aware clients fall back to global chat
- Gradual migration path available

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, scalable solution for project-specific chat isolation that enhances the multi-project workflow while maintaining excellent performance and user experience. The system seamlessly integrates with existing infrastructure and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
