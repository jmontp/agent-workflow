## ADR-001: WebSocket-Based Real-Time Architecture

### Status
**Accepted** - Implemented in production

### Context
The AI Agent Workflow system requires real-time state updates to be pushed to multiple connected clients (browsers) simultaneously. Traditional polling approaches would create unnecessary server load and introduce latency that degrades the user experience for a real-time monitoring system.

### Decision
We will use Socket.IO (WebSocket with fallbacks) as the primary communication mechanism between the browser clients and the Flask server. All state updates will be pushed via WebSocket events rather than pulled via HTTP requests.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Instant Updates**: Sub-100ms latency for state changes reaching all connected clients
- **Efficient**: No wasted bandwidth from polling empty responses  
- **Bidirectional**: Enables features like typing indicators and presence
- **Fallback Support**: Socket.IO provides automatic fallback to long-polling
- **Room Support**: Built-in support for project-specific channels

#### Negative
- **Complexity**: More complex than REST API for simple operations
- **Stateful**: Requires connection state management
- **Scaling**: Requires Redis adapter for multi-instance deployments
- **Debugging**: WebSocket traffic harder to inspect than HTTP

#### Technical Implementation
```python
# Server-side implementation
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*", async_mode='threading')

@socketio.on('state_update')
def handle_state_update(data):
    room = f"project_{data['project_name']}"
    emit('state_changed', data, room=room, broadcast=True)
```

```javascript
// Client-side implementation
const socket = io({
    transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
    upgrade: true
});

socket.on('state_changed', (data) => {
    updateUIWithNewState(data);
});
```

## ADR-002: Discord-Style Chat Interface

### Status
**Accepted** - Implemented and refined through user feedback

### Context
Users of the AI Agent system are developers familiar with Discord's bot command interface. The system needs a text-based command interface that feels natural and supports complex command syntax with parameters.

### Decision
Implement a Discord-style chat interface with slash commands, autocomplete, typing indicators, and command history. The interface should visually and functionally mirror Discord's design patterns.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Familiar UX**: Zero learning curve for Discord users
- **Rich Features**: Autocomplete, history, typing indicators enhance usability
- **Natural Flow**: Conversation-style interaction feels intuitive
- **Mobile Friendly**: Text input works well on all devices
- **Command Discovery**: Slash triggers autocomplete for command discovery

#### Negative
- **Complexity**: Significant implementation effort for full Discord parity
- **Expectations**: Users expect Discord-level polish and features
- **Custom UI**: Can't reuse standard form components
- **Accessibility**: Requires careful ARIA implementation

#### Design Decisions
1. **Visual Design**: Dark theme matching Discord's color palette
2. **Interaction Model**: Slash commands with inline parameter hints
3. **Message Types**: User, bot, system messages with distinct styling
4. **Rich Embeds**: Support for structured data display in messages
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Up/down for history, tab for autocomplete

## ADR-003: Multi-Project Isolation Architecture

### Status
**Accepted** - Critical for enterprise deployment

### Context
The system must support multiple independent AI agent workflows running simultaneously. Each project has its own state, chat history, and user permissions. Data leakage between projects would be a critical security issue.

### Decision
Implement complete project isolation using WebSocket rooms, separate storage namespaces, and project-scoped session management. Each project operates as if it were the only project in the system.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Security**: No possibility of cross-project data leakage
- **Scalability**: Projects can be distributed across servers
- **Independence**: Project failures don't affect others
- **Compliance**: Meets data isolation requirements
- **Performance**: Can optimize per-project resources

#### Negative
- **Memory Usage**: Duplicate data structures per project
- **Complexity**: Session and state management more complex
- **Context Switching**: Users must explicitly switch projects
- **Resource Limits**: Need per-project resource management

#### Implementation Architecture
```python
# Project-specific data structures
project_chat_history = {}      # project_name -> messages
project_user_sessions = {}     # user_id -> project_name
project_typing_users = {}      # project_name -> set of users

# WebSocket room isolation
@socketio.on('join_project')
def handle_join_project(data):
    project_name = data['project_name']
    room = f"project_{project_name}"
    join_room(room)
    
    # Send project-specific state
    emit('project_state', get_project_state(project_name))
```

## ADR-004: Nuclear CSS Layout Enforcement

### Status
**Accepted** - Solves critical UI visibility issues

### Context
The state visualization diagrams are the most critical UI element but were being hidden or corrupted by conflicting CSS from various sources (base styles, component styles, third-party libraries). Traditional CSS specificity wasn't sufficient to guarantee visibility.

### Decision
Implement "nuclear" CSS fixes using extremely specific selectors, !important declarations, and a phased approach to progressively override any conflicting styles. Create a dedicated nuclear-layout-fix.css file loaded last.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Guaranteed Visibility**: Critical UI elements always visible
- **Conflict Proof**: Survives any third-party CSS
- **Clear Intent**: Nuclear naming makes purpose obvious
- **Maintainable**: All overrides in one place
- **Debugging**: Easy to identify nuclear rules

#### Negative
- **Performance**: Multiple reflows during enforcement
- **Flexibility**: Very hard to override when needed
- **Maintenance**: Must be updated if HTML structure changes
- **Code Smell**: !important generally considered bad practice

#### Technical Approach
```css
/* Phase 1: Reset everything */
.app-layout * {
    position: static !important;
    display: initial !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
}

/* Phase 2: Rebuild critical layout */
.app-layout {
    display: flex !important;
    position: relative !important;
    overflow: visible !important;
}

/* Phase 3: Ensure diagram visibility */
.main-content .diagram-container {
    display: block !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    z-index: 9999 !important;
}
```

### Lessons Learned
- Sometimes "bad" practices are necessary for critical functionality
- Phased approach minimizes side effects
- Clear documentation essential for future maintainers
- Consider nuclear CSS as last resort only

## ADR-005: JavaScript Module Consolidation

### Status
**Accepted** - 24.6% code reduction achieved

### Context
The codebase had grown to 15+ JavaScript files with significant duplication. Common operations like DOM manipulation, error handling, and WebSocket communication were reimplemented in multiple places, leading to inconsistencies and maintenance burden.

### Decision
Consolidate common functionality into shared utility modules while preserving component boundaries. Create three core modules: dom-utils.js, websocket-manager.js, and error-manager.js.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Code Reduction**: 568KB → 428KB (24.6% reduction)
- **Consistency**: Same behavior across all components
- **Maintenance**: Fix once, benefit everywhere
- **Performance**: Smaller total download size
- **Testability**: Centralized units easier to test

#### Negative
- **Coupling**: Components now depend on shared modules
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer
- **Migration**: Significant refactoring effort
- **Bundle Size**: Individual modules larger

#### Consolidation Strategy
1. **Identify Duplication**: Scan for repeated patterns
2. **Extract Common**: Move to utility modules
3. **Preserve APIs**: Keep component interfaces stable
4. **Update Imports**: Point to new shared modules
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure no regressions

#### Results Summary
```
Before: 15 files, 568,025 bytes
After:  12 files, 428,385 bytes
Removed: 3 files, 139,640 bytes saved

Key consolidations:
- DOM operations: 40+ duplicate functions eliminated
- WebSocket handling: Single connection manager
- Error handling: Unified notification system
```

## ADR-006: Centralized Error Management

### Status
**Accepted** - Improved error visibility and recovery

### Context
Errors were handled inconsistently across components, leading to poor user experience and difficult debugging. Some errors silently failed, others showed technical messages, and recovery strategies were ad-hoc.

### Decision
Implement a centralized error management system with categorization, user-friendly messages, automatic recovery strategies, and comprehensive logging.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Consistency**: All errors handled uniformly
- **User Experience**: Friendly messages with actions
- **Recovery**: Automatic retry and fallback
- **Debugging**: Centralized logging and tracking
- **Analytics**: Error patterns and frequency data

#### Negative
- **Overhead**: Additional processing for each error
- **Abstraction**: Another layer between error and handler
- **Configuration**: Recovery strategies need tuning
- **Dependencies**: All components must use the system

#### Error Categories
```javascript
const ErrorCategories = {
    NETWORK: {
        recovery: 'retry',
        userMessage: 'Connection issue. Retrying...',
        maxRetries: 3
    },
    VALIDATION: {
        recovery: 'user_action',
        userMessage: 'Please check your input',
        maxRetries: 0
    },
    PERMISSION: {
        recovery: 'escalate',
        userMessage: 'Access denied. Contact admin.',
        maxRetries: 0
    }
};
```

## ADR-007: Progressive Enhancement Strategy

### Status
**Accepted** - Enables graceful degradation

### Context
The system integrates with multiple optional components (orchestrator, state broadcaster, collaboration manager). Hard dependencies would make the system fragile and difficult to develop/test in isolation.

### Decision
Implement progressive enhancement where all optional dependencies are detected at runtime with graceful fallbacks. Core functionality works without any integrations.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Resilience**: System works even if dependencies fail
- **Development**: Can develop/test in isolation
- **Deployment**: Gradual rollout possible
- **Debugging**: Clear feature availability
- **Flexibility**: Optional features truly optional

#### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple code paths to maintain
- **Testing**: Must test with/without each feature
- **Performance**: Runtime feature detection overhead
- **Confusion**: Users might not know why features missing

#### Implementation Pattern
```python
# Progressive enhancement pattern
try:
    from orchestrator import Orchestrator
    ORCHESTRATOR_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    logger.warning("Orchestrator not available - using mock")
    ORCHESTRATOR_AVAILABLE = False

# Later in code
if ORCHESTRATOR_AVAILABLE:
    result = orchestrator.process_command(cmd)
else:
    result = mock_orchestrator.process_command(cmd)
```

## ADR-008: State Synchronization Pattern

### Status
**Accepted** - Ensures consistency across clients

### Context
Multiple clients need to stay synchronized with the workflow state, which can change from various sources (user commands, agent actions, system events). State conflicts and race conditions must be prevented.

### Decision
Implement an event-sourced state synchronization pattern where all state changes flow through a central broadcaster and clients receive atomic state updates.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Consistency**: All clients see same state
- **Atomic Updates**: No partial state changes
- **Event History**: Can replay state changes
- **Debugging**: Clear state transition log
- **Recovery**: Can rebuild state from events

#### Negative
- **Latency**: All changes must go through broadcaster
- **Complexity**: Event sourcing adds abstraction
- **Storage**: Event history can grow large
- **Ordering**: Must handle out-of-order events

#### State Flow
```
Command → Orchestrator → State Change → Broadcaster → All Clients
                          ↑                              ↓
                     State Store ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Client Updates
```

### Context
The system handles sensitive AI agent operations and must prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, and malicious commands. Security cannot be an afterthought.

### Decision
Implement defense-in-depth with multiple security layers: input validation, authentication, authorization, audit logging, and secure defaults.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Audit Trail**: Complete operation history
- **Compliance**: Meets security requirements
- **User Trust**: Visible security measures
- **Incident Response**: Good forensic data

#### Negative
- **Performance**: Validation overhead
- **Complexity**: Multiple checks per operation
- **User Friction**: More authentication steps
- **Development Time**: Security adds effort

#### Security Layers
1. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user input
2. **Authentication**: Verify user identity
3. **Authorization**: Check operation permissions
4. **Project Isolation**: Enforce project boundaries
5. **Audit Logging**: Record all operations
6. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
7. **Encryption**: Protect data in transit

## ADR-010: Performance Optimization Strategy

### Status
**Accepted** - Achieved significant improvements

### Context
Initial implementation had performance issues: slow page loads, janky animations, high memory usage. Users expect instant responsiveness for a real-time monitoring tool.

### Decision
Implement multi-layer performance optimizations: CSS consolidation, JavaScript bundling, lazy loading, caching, and WebSocket message batching.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- **Load Time**: 45% faster initial page load
- **Runtime**: Smooth 60fps animations
- **Memory**: 30% reduction in heap usage
- **Network**: 50% fewer WebSocket messages
- **Scalability**: Handles 5x more concurrent users

#### Negative
- **Complexity**: Optimization code adds complexity
- **Debugging**: Harder to trace optimized code
- **Build Time**: Additional build steps
- **Cache Issues**: Cache invalidation challenges

#### Optimization Techniques
1. **CSS Variables**: Reduce parsing overhead
2. **Code Splitting**: Load features on demand
3. **Message Batching**: Combine WebSocket updates
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large message lists
5. **Web Workers**: Offload heavy computations
6. **Service Worker**: Cache static assets
7. **CDN**: Serve assets from edge locations

#### Performance Metrics
```javascript
// Before optimization
Initial Load: 3.2s
Time to Interactive: 4.5s
Memory Usage: 125MB
WebSocket Messages/sec: 50

// After optimization  
Initial Load: 1.8s (-44%)
Time to Interactive: 2.4s (-47%)
Memory Usage: 87MB (-30%)
WebSocket Messages/sec: 25 (-50%)
```
