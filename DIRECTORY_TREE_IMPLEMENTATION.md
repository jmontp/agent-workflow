# Directory Tree Visualization Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a Claude-powered directory tree visualization that shows the project structure with AI-generated descriptions for each file and folder.

## What Was Removed
- **3D Explorer**: The Three.js-based 3D graph visualization was removed as it wasn't working properly
- **Quality Heatmap**: The documentation quality matrix visualization was removed as it provided limited value

## What Was Added

### 1. Data Model Enhancements
- Added `description` field to `DocMetadata` class for documentation files
- Added `description` field to `CodeMetadata` class for code files  
- Added `folder_descriptions` dictionary to `ProjectIndex` for directory-level descriptions

### 2. Claude Tools Integration
Created two new methods in `claude_tools.py`:
- `generate_file_description(file_path, content, file_type)`: Generates 1-2 sentence descriptions for files
- `generate_folder_description(folder_path, contents)`: Generates descriptions for directories based on their contents

Currently uses heuristics to generate descriptions, but designed to be replaced with actual Claude API calls.

### 3. Indexing Process Updates
- `_scan_documentation()`: Now generates descriptions for each doc file during scanning
- `_scan_code()`: Now generates descriptions for each code file during scanning
- `_generate_folder_descriptions()`: New method that generates descriptions for all directories after file scanning

### 4. Directory Tree Visualization

#### Backend (`/api/context/visualization/directory-tree`)
- Recursively builds a hierarchical tree structure
- Includes Claude-generated descriptions for every node
- Provides file metrics (LOC, functions, classes, etc.)
- Automatically finds the project root

#### Frontend (`DirectoryTreeView` class)
- Collapsible tree structure with expand/collapse functionality
- File type icons (üêç for Python, üìù for Markdown, etc.)
- Shows description preview inline (truncated to 50 chars)
- Details panel shows full information when clicking nodes
- Supports nested directory structures

## How It Works

1. **During `cm init`**:
   - Files are scanned and analyzed
   - Claude tools generate descriptions for each file
   - Folder descriptions are generated based on contents
   - Everything is saved to the project index

2. **In the Web UI**:
   - User clicks "Directory Tree" visualization
   - Frontend fetches tree data from API
   - Tree is rendered with collapsible nodes
   - Clicking items shows full details in side panel

## Benefits
- **Immediate Understanding**: See what each file/folder does at a glance
- **Project Navigation**: Descriptions help find the right files quickly  
- **Team Onboarding**: New developers can understand codebase structure
- **Git Integration**: Descriptions are stored in `aw_docs/` and can be tracked

## Example Descriptions
- **Code Files**: "Main application entry point with Flask web server."
- **Doc Files**: "Project overview and setup instructions."
- **Folders**: "Source code directory with 15 code files implementing core functionality."

## Future Enhancements
- Replace heuristic descriptions with actual Claude API calls
- Add search/filter functionality in the tree view
- Show file change indicators (new, modified, etc.)
- Add context menu actions (open, edit, etc.)
